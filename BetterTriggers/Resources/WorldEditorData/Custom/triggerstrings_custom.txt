BlzTriggerRegisterPlayerSyncEventHint="Create an event that listens to messages with a given prefix sent by a player. (see: 'Send Synchronization Data' action). The data and prefix being sent is limited to 255 bytes. 'Triggering Player' is the message source."

BTRegisterGenericFrameEventHint="Registers a frame event. Use 'Event Response - Triggering Frame' to refer to the frame raising the event. Use 'Event Response - Triggering Frame Player' to refer to the player who interacted with the frame. 'Event Response - Triggering Player' does not work with this event."

BlzEnableUIAutoPositionHint="Disabling auto position will prevent the game from using default positions for changed hidden frames as soon they reappear/their state is changed."

BlzHideOriginFramesHint="(De)Activates some auto-repositioning of default frames (see: 'Enable/Disable Auto Position')."

BlzLoadTOCFileHint="Loads in a TOCFile (Table of Contents) to add/define Frame-Blueprints or localized strings. A TOC file contains a list. Each line is a path to a FDF (Frame Definition File) and is not case sensitve. @bug The TOC needs to end with one or two empty lines."

BlzCreateFrameBTHint="Create a new frame using a Frame-BluePrint name (fdf) as child of owner. BluePrint needs to be loaded over TOC & FDF. Owner and BluePrint have to be from the Frame family. Created frames are stored into the game's Frame-Storage, 'Get Frame By Name'. Overwrites occupied slots."

BlzCreateSimpleFrameBTHint="Like 'Create Frame' but for the SimpleFrame family, Frame 'SIMPLExxxx'. Only Frames loaded by used TOCs are valid names."

BlzCreateFrameByTypeBTHint="Create and define a new frame. Can use a root-Frame-BluePrint with inherits, when that is done it needs to be a loaded BluePrint."

BlzFrameClearAllPointsHint="Unbinds all points of a frame. Useful to move frames with the next 'Attach Frame to Frame'."

BlzFrameClickHint="Ignores visibility. Triggers a 'Click' event."

BlzFrameSetTextHint="Supports formatting codes (example: |cffffcc00)."

BlzFrameSetTextColorHint="Four byte integer of the form 0xaarrggbb. You can also use 'Convert Color' to create such an integer."

BlzFrameSetEnableBTHint="Turns on/off interactivity/events of frame. A disabled frame is transparent to the mouse (can click on things behind it) and can have a different color/texture/frame than in enabled state. The frame's tooltip is still shown on hover. Removes keyboard focus when disabled."

BlzFrameSetAlphaHint="Also affects child-frames when they don't have their own alpha."

BlzFrameSetAbsPointBTHint="The center of the screen is (0.4, 0.3). More information can be found on www.hiveworkshop.com"

BlzFrameSetSizeHint="A size of (0.8, 0.6) fills the entire original 4:3 aspect ratio screen with the frame. More information can be found on www.hiveworkshop.com"

BlzFrameSetTextureHint="Overwrites some FDF setups."

BlzFrameSetScaleHint="Also affects child-frames when they don't have their own scale."

BlzFrameSetTooltipHint="A tooltip frame is visible when hovered with the mouse. Otherwise the tooltip will be hidden. A tooltip is limited to 4:3 screen space, but not it's children. A tooltip frame can only serve one frame. @bug Frames should not be used as tooltips for simple frames (Crash on WC3 v1.31)."

BlzFrameCageMouseHint="The mouse cursor is forced into the frame and cannot leave it. New 'cages' will overwrite old ones. Some frames cannot be used to cage the mouse."

BlzFrameSetValueHint="Changes the current value of a frame. Only for frametypes that use this feature: POPUPMENU, SLIDER, SIMPLESTATUSBAR, STATUSBAR."

BlzFrameSetStepSizeHint="Changes the step accuracy for SLIDER frames."

BlzFrameSetVertexColorHint="SimpleFrames only."

BlzFrameSetLevelHint="Changes the Z position of a frame. A higher value puts a frame in front of lower level frames (Default: 0). A value of -3 puts the frame behind the rendered game, disappearing from view. Simpleframes have fixed internal layers which only contain string/textures. For Simpleframes, level sets them higher/lower to all other Simpleframes."

BlzEnableCursorHint="Sets cursor visibility."

BlzSetMousePosHint="X & Y are pixels up to the used resolution 'Game Window Width' 'Game Window Height'."

BlzSendSyncDataHint="Data and prefix limited to 255 bytes each. Should be used inside a 'Local Player'-if-statement"

BlzDisplayChatMessageHint="Displays a message in chat as if it was sent by the specified player. The message does not appear in Log (F12)."
